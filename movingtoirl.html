                       <b>Immigration</b>
                      <p>People from all over the world immigrate to Ireland. Whether you’re a student hoping
                        to get your next degree, a professional looking to take your career to the next level,
                        or are even thinking about making Ireland home for you and your family you will find the
                        information in this page useful to you.</p>
                      <p>Based on your nationality you can find what you need to enter Ireland by using the link
                        mentioned below. Simply select your nationality from the dropdown menu, select how long you’re
                        planning on staying and type of visa required. You’ll then be given a list of what you need to
                        do before you travel, when you travel, and after you’ve arrived in Ireland. If you’re intending
                        to stay for less than 90 days, you should apply for a short-stay ‘C’ visa. For those who plan to
                        work and live in Ireland for more than 90 days, you’ll need to apply for the long-stay ‘D’ visa.</p>
                        <p>Visas are issued by the Department of Justice and Equality. You can make your online application
                          from your home country and submit your hard copy application and supporting documentation to the
                          relevant Irish Embassy/Consulate/Visa Office. If you’re coming from the
                          European Economic Area (EEA -countries of the EU and Norway, Iceland & Liechtenstein) or
                          Switzerland you don’t need a visa for Ireland or a work permit. If your spouse/civil partner are
                          an EU/EEA citizen, then you might be able to skip the visa/work permit process.

                       <b>Education</b>
                      <p>Although children are not obliged to attend school until the age of six, almost all children begin
                        school in the September following their fourth birthday. Nearly 40% of four-year-olds and almost all
                        five-year-olds are enrolled in infant classes in primary schools (sometimes called national schools).
                        Three levels of Ireland’s education system are primary, secondary and higher education.
                      </P>
                      <p>
                        Primary education consists of an eight year cycle: junior infants, senior infants, and first to sixth classes.
                        Pupils normally transfer to post-primary education at the age of twelve.The secondary school system
                        in Ireland consists of 6 years of study, which is divided into two cycles, Junior and Senior.
                        Schools in Ireland follow a curriculum set down by the Irish Department of Education and Science (www.education.ie)
                        so whether in private or state school, all students follow the same courses and take the same state examinations.

                      <p>A wide range of institutions in Ireland provide <b>third-level education</b>. The university sector,
                        the technological sector and the colleges of education are substantially funded by the State.
                        In addition, there are a number of independent private colleges. The Higher Education Authority
                        is the statutory agency responsible for the funding of universities, institutes of technology and
                        certain other higher education institutions. It has an advisory role in relation to the whole sector
                        of third-level education.

                       <b>Employment</b>
                      <p>Whether you are currently in work, unemployed or in education, the process of finding and applying for
                        a job is the same. It is important to research all possible sources of information on employment
                        opportunities, to send in a well-prepared job application with a relevant cover letter and
                        CV (curriculum vitae) and, if your application is not successful, to continue the search
                        for employment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Employment permits are issued by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Once an
                          employee holds an employment permit and is working, they have the same Irish Employment Rights
                          as Irish citizens. There are numerous types of employment permits available, but for those looking
                          to enter the tech industry, there are two main routes; the Critical Skills Employment Permit and
                          the General Employment Permit.

                       <b>Driving</b>
                      <p>It is possible to exchange a driving licence issued by an EU member state or an EEA member state
                        (Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) for an Irish driving licence. It is also possible to exchange
                        a driving licence issued by certain recognised states for an Irish driving licence. If your driving
                        licence is issued by a country that is not recognised for driving licence exchange, you cannot
                        exchange your licence for an Irish licence. You will need to go through the full driver licensing
                        procedure starting with the driver theory test. However, when you have your learner permit, you will
                        only need to take 6 essential driver training (EDT) lessons instead of the usual 12 lessons. You can
                        access the rules of the road on the Road Safety Authority’s website.

                      <p>Important facts,
                      </p>
                      <li>In Ireland, you drive on the left-hand side of the road.</li>
                      <li>Yield to all vehicles coming from your right and always turn left on entering a roundabout.</li>
                      <li>You must be at least 17 years old to drive in Ireland.</li>
                      <li>Speed limits in Ireland are in kilometres.</li>
                      <li>The speed limit is 50km/h in built-up areas, 80km/h on regional and local roads, 100km/h on national roads and 120km/h on motorways. Be sure to keep an eye out for speed signs and make sure you’re not over or you will receive an €80 fine and 3 penalty points.</li>
                      <li>All vehicle occupants are required to wear seat belts at all times.</li>
                      <li>For those riding on motorcycles, helmets must be worn at all times.</li>
                      <li>Use of mobile/cell phones while driving is strictly prohibited.</li>
                      <li>At all times, you are required to carry a valid driving licence; your car must display both proof of insurance and a motor tax disc and, if the car is over four years old, the National Car Test (NCT) disc must also be displayed.</li>
                      <li>The minimum insurance you must have before you drive a car in Ireland is Third Party Only cover.</li>

                       <b>Accommodation</b>
                      <p>There are numerous choices when it comes to the kind of accommodation you can rent or buy, such as
                        houses, apartments, or house shares. House shares (renting a private bedroom in a shared house), are a
                        very common option in Ireland, especially for single people in larger cities where demand and rents are
                        high. Rents and house prices vary widely by location and are higher in cities. Of course, while rent in
                        Dublin is higher than other parts of the country, it also has the widest range of amenities and access
                        to jobs, as well as an excellent transport system. In big areas the housing market is more competitive.
                        Prepare for a first come, first served approach and be proactive in making enquiries and arranging viewings.
                        Letting agents can also help you find the perfect home, and may also provide administrative, management
                        and other services for the property, but there will be an added fee.
